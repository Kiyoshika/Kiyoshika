# Kiyoshika
My name is Zach, Kiyoshika is random alias I used in a game called RuneScape.

I'm a self-taught programmer but also pretty passionate about statistics.

I heavily prefer statically typed languages, more specifically C and C++. I love memory management and pointers even though it can be frustrating at times.

Despite my profile picture, I don't really watch much anime these days. But I may watch it once every few months.

## Toolkit
* **C99** - Currently my primary programming language
* **C++17** - Secondary programming language
* **Python** - Usually only use this when I have to, although I am now working on some C --> Python bindings for practice
* **R** - Only use this for statistical projects; I have a few repos on here that show some things I've built with R.

## Main Projects
Currently my main projects are:
* [Zumpy](https://github.com/Kiyoshika/Zumpy) - A numpy-inspired array module for Python written in C. I started this project to understand how to use shared libraries in other languages, specifically Python.
* [ZSL](https://github.com/Kiyoshika/ZSL) - Acronyn for "Zach's Statistical Library". This is a re-implementation of an old C++ library I built called CppEZML (now archived). Currently this project is on hiatus in favor of Zumpy.

## Mini Projects
* [C-CSV-Parser](https://github.com/Kiyoshika/C-CSV-Parser) - A simple CSV parser which supports reading full CSV files or only specific columns and casting data to int/float. Will probably be used in my future projects that deal with external data.
* [C-Hash-Map](https://github.com/Kiyoshika/C-Hash-Map) - A custom hashmap implementation for C which relies on another of my projects, [C-Linked-List](https://github.com/Kiyoshika/C-Linked-List) which is a linked list implementation for C.

## Upcoming Proejcts?
These projects are not finalized but some things I *may* work on (given the time):
* [C-Source-Tracker]() - A code tracking software inspired by git to manage local repositories of code/files.
