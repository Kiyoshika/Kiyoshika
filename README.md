# Kiyoshika
My name is Zach, Kiyoshika is random alias I used in a game called RuneScape.

I'm a self-taught programmer but also pretty passionate about statistics.

I heavily prefer statically typed languages, more specifically C and C++. I love memory management and pointers even though it can be frustrating at times.

Despite my profile picture, I don't really watch much anime these days. But I may watch it once every few months.

## Toolkit
* **C99** - Currently my primary programming language
* **C++17** - Secondary programming language
* **Python** - Usually only use this when I have to, although I am now working on some C --> Python bindings for practice
* **R** - Only use this for statistical projects; I have a few repos on here that show some things I've built with R.

## Projects
### Libraries
* [Generalized Model Framework (libgmf)](https://github.com/Kiyoshika/Generalized-Model-Framework) - A very flexible optimization framework for building different types of predictive models with modularity in mind - like legos, but for predictive modelling.
* [Zumpy](https://github.com/Kiyoshika/Zumpy) - A numpy-inspired array module for Python written in C. I started this project to understand how to use shared libraries in other languages, specifically Python.
* [C-CSV-Parser](https://github.com/Kiyoshika/C-CSV-Parser) - A simple CSV parser which supports reading full CSV files or only specific columns and casting data to int/float.
* [C-Hash-Map](https://github.com/Kiyoshika/C-Hash-Map) - A custom hashmap implementation for C which relies on another of my projects, [C-Linked-List](https://github.com/Kiyoshika/C-Linked-List) which is a linked list implementation for C.

### Algorithms
* [Generic Quicksort](https://github.com/Kiyoshika/Generic-Quicksort) - A templated generic quicksort algorithm in C++ to support native and user-defined data types.

### Software
* [Source Tracker](https://github.com/Kiyoshika/Source-Tracker) - A heavily simplified "git" clone for local version control of files/code. I started this project to learn more about file management in C++ (using C++17's filesystem API).

### Embedded
* [Clone Hero Controller](https://github.com/Kiyoshika/CloneHeroController) - My first embedded project, a minature game controller for playing Clone Hero assembled (messily) onto a breadboard with a STM32F411xx microcontroller.
